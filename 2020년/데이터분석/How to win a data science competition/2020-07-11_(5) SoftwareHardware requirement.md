## Software & Hardware Requirement

### Hardware

- Most of competitions (expect image-based) can be solved on :
  - High-level laptop
  - 16+ gb ram
  - 4+ cores
- Quite good setup :
  - Tower PC
  - 32+ gb ram
  - 6+ cores



#### Really import things:

- RAM
  - If you can keep data in memory - everything will be much easier
- Cores
  - More cores you have - more (of faster) experiments you can do
- Storage
  - SSD is crucial if  you work with images or big datasets with a lot of small pieces



#### Cloud resources

Cloud platforms can provide you with a computational resources.

There are several cloud options :

- Amazon AWS (spot option ??)
- Microsoft Azure
- Google cloud



### Software

Most of competitors use Python data science software stack.

- Basic stack : Numpy, Pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib
- IDE : Jupyter notebook
- Special packages : XGBoost, Keras, LightGBM, tsne
- External tools
  - Vowpal Wabbit : 거대한 데이터셋을 핸들링할 때 유용
  - libfm, libffm : sparce한 CTR 데이터를 다룰 때 유용
  - fast_rgf : 또 다른 tree-based 방법
